To run this: python 9-panel.py CMD-File-Name Calcsfh-final-output-name What-you-want-to-name-the-plot

Things in the code you might want to edit, (which I am still updating as well): 
1. Lines 60 and 84: change cmap = cm to cmap = whatever colors you want 
2. Line 60: change clim to whatever you want the scaling of the colormap to be (see lines 295-300)
3. Line For the scale of the actual CMDs, like the x and y limits, see lines 71 and 73, (which are from lines 236-239)

I definitely haven't beautified this plot yet, but it works fine, aside from the x and y limit scaling issues.
